# Convex-polygon-Pieces
C++ programs to break any arbitrary polygon into convex polygon pieces

We have implemented the algorithm of the paper : 
Fernández, J., Cánovas, L., & Pelegrın, B. (2000). Algorithms for the decomposition of a polygon into ́
convex polygons. European Journal of Operational Research, 121(2), 330-342.
